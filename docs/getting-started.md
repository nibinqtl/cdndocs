# Quick Start

Using CDN360 to accelerate and distribute your content involves the following steps:

1. [Log in](</docs/portal/accessing-portal/logging-in.md>) to the portal.
2. [Create a property](</docs/portal/properties/managing-properties.md>), which is the configuration to be deployed to the proxy server(s).
3. [Edit the property](</docs/portal/properties/editing-properties.md>) if necessary.
4. [Validate the property](</docs/portal/properties/validating-property.md>).
5. Optional [Deploy the property to staging servers](</docs/portal/properties/deploying-property.md>) and make sure the cache behaves as expected.
6. [Deploy the property to production servers](</docs/portal/properties/deploying-property.md>) and make sure the cache behaves as expected.
7. [Create a CNAME](</docs/portal/cnames/creating-cname.md>) for the hostname.
8. Modify your DNS records to point your hostname(s) to the CNAME.

The following figure shows the steps for creating an acceleration service for a hostname.
