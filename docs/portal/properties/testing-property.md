# Testing Property

Before you deploy your property to production, we recommend you test and verify your property to make sure it works as expected. CDN360 has a dedicated staging environment for this purpose.

## Testing Your Property in Staging

CDN360 provides a staging environment for you to test your property configurations without affecting production. Sending your test traffic to the servers in the staging environment is a way for you to make sure the behavior is what you expect. Those staging servers can be found by the hostname `staging.qtlgslb.com`. You can also easily see the their IP address by running:

```bash
$ dig staging.qtlgslb.com
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
staging.qtlgslb.com.	59	IN	A	163.171.233.53
staging.qtlgslb.com.	59	IN	A	163.171.228.89
staging.qtlgslb.com.	59	IN	A	163.171.230.47
...
```

There are multiple ways to send test traffic to the staging environment:


- Modify your DNS server to point your hostname to the CDN360 staging hostname ```staging.qtlgslb.com```. For example:

```
faster.mydomain.com CNAME staging.qtlgslb.com
```

If you are using a smart DNS service, you can also direct a small portion of the production traffic to the staging CNAME to have a more thorough test.
- Modify the ```/etc/hosts``` file to hard code the hostname to be accelerated to one of the staging servers IP addresses. For example:


```
163.171.233.53 faster.mydomain.com
```
- If the cURL command is used, the ```--resolve``` option can be used to directly map the hostname to be accelerated to the IP address of the CDN360 staging server(s). For example:

```bash
$ curl -v https://faster.mydomain.com/index.html --resolve faster.mydomain.com:443:163.171.233.53
```
