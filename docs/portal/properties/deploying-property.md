# Deploying Your Property

After you create a property, you can deploy it to the staging environment to make sure it is configured properly and that your visitors can access the expected content. Once you confirm that the property is ready to go live, you can deploy it to the production environment.

1. In the left pane, click **Properties**. 

2. On the Properties page, click the ID of the property you want to deploy. 

    <br><u>OR</u></br><br>

    Click the **Actions** menu for the property you want to deploy, and then select **Edit**.

3. Scroll down to the **Deployment** section, select either **Staging** or **Production** from the drop-down list, and then click the **Deploy Configuration** button.

4. If the selected property is already deployed to the production environment, the next form compares the deployed property with the one you want to deploy to production. Compare the two properties, and then click **Deploy to Production** to deploy the selected property or **Back** to not deploy the property.

5. When the Deployment Confirmation pop-up appears, click **OK**. Wait for the message that the configuration has been successfully deployed, or click the **Go to Dashboard** button to perform other tasks while the deployment continues in the background. When the validation completes, click **Tasks** in the left pane to confirm that the property was deployed successfully.

6. Test your deployment in the [staging](</docs/portal/properties/testing-property.md#testing-property-in-staging>) or [production](/docs/portal/properties/testing-property.md#testing-property-in-production>) environment.
