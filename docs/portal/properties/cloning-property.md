# Cloning Properties

After a property version has been deployed to staging or production, it is locked from further changes and no additional edits are permitted. However, you can clone the version of your property to create a new version that you can edit.

1. In the left pane, click **Properties**.
2. On the Properties page, click the ID of the property you want to clone.

    <br><u>OR</u><br><br>

    Click the **Actions** menu for the property you want to clone, and then select **Edit**.<br><br>

3. Next to the **Version Number** field, click the **Clone** button.
