# Welcome to CDN360

CDN360 leads the evolution of content delivery networks (CDNs) by accelerating, securing, scaling, and delivering content to website visitors worldwide, regardless of their location. With points of presence on every continent, visitor requests are routed to edge servers based on factors such as proximity and resource/content availability.

By keeping content close to requesting website visitors, utilizing intelligent request routing, and employing high-performance computing, storage, and network resources, CDN360:

- Reduces workloads on origin servers by more than 90%.
- Slashes Time-To-First-Byte (TTFB) latencies.
- Achieves superior SEO and bounce-rate reduction.
- Improves user experiences.

## CDN360 Key Features

- Rich API and Edge Logic empower you to implement features at the CDN level without touching your application codebase.
- Sophisticated access-control algorithms can be implemented using Edge Logic to process requests and protected content at the edge.
- Requests and responses are processed at the edge using familiar tools such as NGINX configuration scripts and JavaScript.
- Flexible cost/performance management empowers you to customize service coverage, so you can manage expenses according to the performance you need.
- Internet and direct traffic are monitored dynamically based on real-time performance metrics and system-load information.
- High-level view of your network traffic and site performance can be viewed and printed as a customized report for analysis.
- Support for reaching customers in mainland China. (CDNetworks can also help to secure all necessary permissions and licenses.)

## CDN360 Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The CDN360 content delivery platform makes it easy for anyone with a minimum CDN background to get started, yet is sufficiently powerful for advanced users as well.

The platform's customizable point-and-click user interface provides granular controls for:

- Self-configuring edge servers and service coverage to meet performance needs while reducing data transport costs and latencies.
- Choosing the best way to fetch content from the origin and deciding where to store it on CDN360 servers.
- Customizing global traffic management rules and selecting advanced settings for any CNAME you create.
- Testing behaviors in a dedicated staging environment and then deploying to production — in minutes! 

## CDN360 Application Programming Interface (API)

The CDN360 content delivery platform provides a rich [API](</apidocs>) that supports the same functions as the CDN360 GUI, along with advanced configuration capabilities. Using the API, developers can have their applications interact with CDN360 by sending and receiving JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data.
